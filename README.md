# Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This project is about analysis of Dijkstra Algorithm.  On report, explanation of the algorithm, calculation of the running time and the explanation of the code and GUI can be found. The every iteration of the algorithm can be seen in the GUI dynamically. 

# Code

Project is written with Python. Code has the implemantation of the algorithm and UI. For UI Tkinter library is used.

# GUI

In GUI the graph is created according to desired number of node which given by user. Atfer that user can give the desired starting node and destination node to program. The every iteration of the algorithm can be seen in the GUI dynamically. 

# Conclusion

To use the program run main.py file. More information about the project can found in the report.
